# FermiNet: Fermionic Neural Networks

FermiNet is a neural network for learning highly accurate ground state
wavefunctions of atoms and molecules using a variational Monte Carlo approach.

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm and experiments
first described in "Ab-Initio Solution of the Many-Electron Schroedinger
Equation with Deep Neural Networks", David Pfau, James S. Spencer, Alex G de G
Matthews and W.M.C. Foulkes, Phys. Rev. Research 2, 033429 (2020), along with
subsequent research and developments.

WARNING: This is a research-level release of a JAX implementation and is under
active development. The original TensorFlow implementation can be found in the
`tf` branch.

## Installation

`pip install -e .` will install all required dependencies. This is best done
inside a [virtual environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).

```shell
virtualenv ~/venv/ferminet
source ~/venv/ferminet/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

If you have a GPU available (highly recommended for fast training), then you can
install JAX with CUDA support, using e.g.:

```shell
pip install --upgrade jax jaxlib==0.1.57+cuda110 -f
https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
```

Note that the jaxlib version must correspond to the existing CUDA installation
you wish to use. Please see the
[JAX documentation](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax#installation) for more
details.

The tests are easiest run using pytest:

```shell
pip install -e '.[testing]'
python -m pytest
```

## Usage

ferminet uses the `ConfigDict` from
[ml_collections](https://github.com/google/ml_collections) to configure the
system. A few example scripts are included under `ferminet/configs/`. These are
mostly for testing so may need additional settings for a production-level
calculation.

```shell
ferminet --config ferminet/configs/atom.py --config.system.atom Li --config.batch_size 256 --config.pretrain.iterations 100
```

will train FermiNet to find the ground-state wavefunction of the Li atom using a
batch size of 1024 MCMC configurations ("walkers" in variational Monte Carlo
language), and 100 iterations of pretraining (the default of 1000 is overkill
for such a small system). The system and hyperparameters can be controlled by
modifying the config file or (better, for one-off changes) using flags. See the
[ml_collections](https://github.com/google/ml_collections)' documentation for
further details on the flag syntax. Details of all available config settings are
in `ferminet/base_config.py`.

Other systems can easily be set up, by creating a new config file or `ferminet`,
or writing a custom training script. For example, to run on the H2 molecule, you
can create a config file containing:

```python
from ferminet import base_config
from ferminet.utils import system

# Settings in a config files are loaded by executing the the get_config
# function.
def get_config():
  # Get default options.
  cfg = base_config.default()
  # Set up molecule
  cfg.system.electrons = (1,1)
  cfg.system.molecule = [system.Atom('H', (0, 0, -1)), system.Atom('H', (0, 0, 1))]

  # Set training hyperparameters
  cfg.batch_size = 256
  cfg.pretrain.iterations = 100

  return cfg
```

and then run it using

```
ferminet --config /path/to/h2_config.py
```

or equivalently write the following script (or execute it interactively):

```python
import sys

from absl import logging
from ferminet.utils import system
from ferminet import base_config
from ferminet import train

# Optional, for also printing training progress to STDOUT.
# If running a script, you can also just use the --alsologtostderr flag.
logging.get_absl_handler().python_handler.stream = sys.stdout
logging.set_verbosity(logging.INFO)

# Define H2 molecule
cfg = base_config.default()
cfg.system.electrons = (1,1)  # (alpha electrons, beta electrons)
cfg.system.molecule = [system.Atom('H', (0, 0, -1)), system.Atom('H', (0, 0, 1))]

# Set training parameters
cfg.batch_size = 256
cfg.pretrain.iterations = 100

train.train(cfg)
```

Alternatively, you can directly pass in a PySCF ['Molecule'](http://pyscf.org).
You can create PySCF Molecules with the following:

```python
from pyscf import gto
mol = gto.Mole()
mol.build(
    atom = 'H  0 0 1; H 0 0 -1',
    basis = 'sto-3g', unit='bohr')
```

Once you have this molecule, you can pass it directly into the configuration by
running

```python
from ferminet import base_config
from ferminet import train

# Add H2 molecule
cfg = base_config.default()
cfg.system.pyscf_mol = mol

# Set training parameters
cfg.batch_size = 256
cfg.pretrain.iterations = 100

train.train(cfg)
```

Note: to train on larger atoms and molecules with large batch sizes, multi-GPU
parallelisation is essential. This is supported via JAX's
[pmap](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#parallelization-pmap).
Multiple GPUs will be automatically detected and used if available.

### Inference

After training, it is useful to run calculations of the energy and other
observables over many time steps with the parameters fixed to accumulate
low-variance estimates of physical quantities. To do this, just re-run the same
command used for training with the flag `--config.optim.optimizer 'none'`. Make
sure that either the value of `cfg.log.save_path` is the same, or that the value
of `cfg.log.restore_path` is set to the value of `cfg.log.save_path` from the
original training run.

It can also be useful to accumulate statistics about observables at inference
time which were not included in the original training run. Spin magnitude,
dipole moments and density matrices can be tracked by adding
`--config.observables.s2`, `--config.observables.dipole` and
`--config.observables.density` to the command line if they are not set to true
in the config file.

## Excited States

Excited state properties of systems can be calculated using either the
[Natural Excited States for VMC (NES-VMC) algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16848)
or an [ensemble penalty method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00693).
To enable the calculation of `k` states of a system, simply set
`cfg.system.states=k` in the config file. By default, NES-VMC is used, but to
enable the ensemble penalty method, add `cfg.optim.objective='vmc_overlap'` to
the config. NES-VMC does not have any parameters to set, but the ensemble
penalty method has a free choice of weights on the energies and overlap penalty,
which can be set in `cfg.optim.overlap`. If the weights are not set for the
energies in the config, they are automatically set to 1/k for state k. We have
found that NES-VMC is generally more accurate than the ensemble penalty method,
but include both for completeness. Config files for all experiments from the
paper which introduced NES-VMC can be found in the folder `configs/excited`, and
all experiments can be tested (on smaller networks) by running
`tests/excited_test.py`.

## Output

The results directory contains `train_stats.csv` which contains the local energy
and MCMC acceptance probability for each iteration, and the `checkpoints`
directory, which contains the checkpoints generated during training. When
computing observables of excited states or the density matrix for the ground
state, `.npy` files are also saved to the same folder. A single NumPy array is
saved for every iteration of optimization into the same file. An example Colab
notebook analyzing these outputs is given in `notebooks/excited_states_analysis.ipynb`.

## Pretrained Models

A collection of pretrained models trained with KFAC can be found on Google Cloud
[here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/dm-ferminet/models).
These are all systems from the original PRResearch paper: carbon and neon atoms,
and nitrogen, ethene, methylamine, ethanol and bicyclobutane molecules. Each
folder contains samples from the wavefunction in `walkers.npy`, parameters in
`parameters.npz` and geometries for the molecule in `geometry.npz`. To load the
models and evaluate the local energy, run:

```python
import numpy as np
import jax
from functools import partial
from ferminet import networks, train

with open('params.npz', 'rb') as f:
  params = dict(np.load(f, allow_pickle=True))
  params = params['arr_0'].tolist()

with open('walkers.npy', 'rb') as f:
  data = np.load(f)

with open('geometry.npz', 'rb') as f:
  geometry = dict(np.load(f, allow_pickle=True))

signed_network = partial(networks.fermi_net, envelope_type='isotropic', full_det=False, **geometry)
# networks.fermi_net gives the sign/log of the wavefunction. We only care about the latter.
network = lambda p, x: signed_network(p, x)[1]
batch_network = jax.vmap(network, (None, 0), 0)
loss = train.make_loss(network, batch_network, geometry['atoms'], geometry['charges'], clip_local_energy=5.0)

print(loss(params, data)[0])  # For neon, should give -128.94165
```
